SOM/SVM cluster prediction

Datasets generated with neuroimaging techniques are large, noisy, and notoriously unwieldy to work with. 
This project is a novel machine learning pipeline/toolkit for clustering, compressing, and ultimately classifying noisy and highly 
multidimensional data such as is generated in neuroimaging research.
