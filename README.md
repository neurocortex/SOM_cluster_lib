# SOM_cluster_lib
Hybrid SOM/SVM clustering, compression, and prediction

Datasets generated with neuroimaging techniques are large, noisy, and notoriously unwieldy to work with. This project is a novel machinelearning pipeline/toolkit for clustering, compressing, and ultimately classifying noisy and highly multidimensional data such as is generated in neuroimaging research.
